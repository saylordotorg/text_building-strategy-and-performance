        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Earlier chapters have given us all the elements we need to develop a complete picture of our business, together with the information that explains why it has performed as it has up to now. These pieces are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">the time chart of one or more performance measures</strong> (e.g., profits, sales, service levels), with scale and timing</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">the list of likely resources involved</strong> (e.g., customers, clients, staff, products, services, cash, capacity)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">the chain of immediate causes for that performance</strong>, often with simple arithmetical relationships (e.g., gross margin, revenue, labor costs, customer demand)</li>
            <li>at the head of those causal chains, <strong class="emphasis bold">the resources driving demand, supply, and performance</strong> (e.g., customers, staff, products, services, cash)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">the flows of resource</strong> (e.g., customers won and lost per month; staff hired, promoted, or leaving per month; products added or discontinued per year) into, through, and out of the organization’s system</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">the immediate causes of these rates of flow</strong>, whether your own decisions or other factors</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">the dependence of each resource flow on existing resources</strong>, either for the same resource or others</li>
        </ul>

It does not, for example, include certain resources, such as the menu or the seating capacity. Nor does it include potentially important factors that could drive changes in performance, such as price or competitors’ actions. The best approach is to include as much of the architecture as is necessary to create a plausible explanation of performance over time.</p>
