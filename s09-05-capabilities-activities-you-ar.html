<span class="title-prefix">8.5</span> Capabilities: Activities You Are Good At</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_p01">Capabilities are especially powerful drivers of performance for businesses and many other kinds of organization (Hamel &amp; Heene,1994; Schoemaker, 1992; Stalk, Evans, &amp; Schulman, 1992). They are the factors that determine how well groups achieve tasks that are critical. For our strategic architecture of resources, the most critical tasks include building and retaining resources. First, let us remind ourselves how capabilities differ from resources:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_l01">
        <li>Resources are useful <em class="emphasis">items</em> that you own or can access.</li>
        <li>Capabilities are <em class="emphasis">activities</em> that your organization is good at performing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_p02">Capabilities are important because they determine how effectively your organization builds, develops, and retains resources. A more capable organization will be able to build resources <em class="emphasis">faster</em> and hold resource losses to a <em class="emphasis">slower</em> rate than a less capable organization. Capabilities, like intangible resources, are abstract and ambiguous items that are difficult to measure and manage. Nevertheless, they are important drivers of performance through time, so some attempt must be made to understand and manage them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_p03">There are three useful reference points to bear in mind when you assess the strength of your capabilities for building resources:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The maximum rate of resource building or retention</strong>. For example, given good products and attractive prices, perfect sales capability would show up as a 100% hit rate in new customer acquisition.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Best practice within the organization</strong>. For example, if all our regional sales teams could build sales per customer as fast as region X does, how quickly would we grow sales?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Benchmarks from firms in comparable sectors</strong>. For example, if all our regional sales teams could build sales per customer as fast as competitor Y does, how quickly would we grow sales?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_p04">A team’s capability is the ratio between the rate at which it is <em class="emphasis">actually</em> achieving tasks and the best rate that we can imagine, given one of the benchmarks above.</p>
    <div class="section" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Skills Versus Capabilities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_p01">Do not confuse team capabilities with individual skills. If you wanted to evaluate the total skills of a group and assess its overall average skill at individual tasks, then you would use the idea of attributes from <a class="xref" href="warren_1.0-ch06#warren_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "You Need Quality Resources as Well as Quantity"</a>. Clever organizations manage to take relatively unskilled people and generate outstanding performance. Consulting firms take newly trained professionals and enable them to deliver sophisticated business solutions; fast-food firms take unskilled staff and produce highly consistent products and service; call centers take people with little understanding of an organization’s products and clients and produce excellent customer support; and so on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_p02">Clearly such organizations achieve much of this performance by training people: in other words, by adding to their individual skills. But they do more: <strong class="emphasis bold">They develop, test, and operate proven procedures</strong>. Team capability, then, reflects the combination of individual skills and these effective procedures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s01_p03">Such procedures add up to a library of instructions for completing specific activities quickly and reliably. This library is effectively a resource, something useful that you own, and like any resource it is built up over time. It is also kept up to date by the removal of obsolete or ineffective procedures and the addition of new ones. One of the clearest examples you are likely to find concerns the franchise manuals used by firms like McDonald’s to both train their staff and control their franchisees. Such manuals cover everything from cleaning the fryers, to checking the inventory, to sorting the garbage.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Capabilities Accelerate Resource Development</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_p01">As I have stressed before, if capabilities are to influence performance then it can <em class="emphasis">only</em> be by improving the organization’s success at developing resources, whether it be winning them in the first place, promoting them from state to state, or retaining them. For example,</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_l01">
            <li>a highly capable human resource (HR) team wins the people that the organization needs quickly, efficiently, and with the greatest likelihood that they will stay;</li>
            <li>a highly capable product development group turns out products quickly and cheaply that satisfy customers’ needs;</li>
            <li>a highly capable customer support team ensures customers are content with the organization’s products and services, thus preventing customer defection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s02_p02">There is a limit to what capable teams can accomplish though if they do not have the resources to do their job. Even the best customer support group will struggle to keep customers if the products they are supporting are inadequate.</p>

    <div class="section" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Learning, Capability Building, and Resource Development</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p01">The last mystery we need to resolve about capabilities is where they come from. Team capabilities are built up by being used, much as individual skills are. Procedures and methods for getting things done are available to be recorded whenever they take place. So techniques have been developed in many sectors for achieving a sale to a new customer, for example. Indeed, many of these techniques are common to multiple markets and embedded in sales force training systems. The procedures for managing products through a research and development (R&amp;D) process similarly arise from companies’ experience of actually carrying out that activity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p02">Clearly the more chances the team has to practice its winning, developing, and retention of resources, the more opportunities arise to test, improve, and record the procedures that work best. The bottom line is that the rate of resource <em class="emphasis">flows</em> determines the rate at which capabilities can be improved. If we add the earlier observation that capability <em class="emphasis">levels</em> drive resource flows, we have a simple and direct mutual reinforcement between each capability and the resource to which it relates. There are some cases where capability <em class="emphasis">does not</em> relate directly to a specific resource flow, but they tend to be less influential on long-term strategic performance than are these tightly coupled pairings of resource and capability.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Action Checklist: Managing the Impact of Intangibles on the Resource System</h3>
            <p class="para" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_p03">This chapter has explained the importance of intangible factors, given examples of simple measures for them, and shown you how they operate. Here are some techniques to ensure your intangibles are healthy and working well with the rest of your business system:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="warren_1.0-ch08_s05_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Identify the important intangibles</strong>. Since your performance comes from concrete resources, start with these and ask whether an intangible factor is likely to influence your ability to win or lose them. However, do not go on an exhaustive search for as many soft factors as possible; each part of your strategic architecture will probably be most strongly influenced by one or two intangibles.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be clear which of these soft factors genuinely accumulate through time and which are simply varying features of your organization</strong>. “Quality” often reflects immediately the balance between what has to be done and what is available to do it, in which case it does not accumulate. Reputation, motivation, commitment, and perception, on the other hand, are built up and drain away over time in response to an entire history of events.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Specify intangibles carefully and identify the best measure</strong>. What exactly is it that drives the choices of each group? That will be the measure that matters. Our IT service firm’s <em class="emphasis">current</em> clients, for example, were strongly influenced by the error rate they experienced, while <em class="emphasis">potential</em> clients responded to the firm’s reputation.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Identify the events causing each intangible to fill up and drain away</strong>. This is the same bathtub principle we have used before, so remember that different items may be featured on either side of this question.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look for places where you can strengthen intangibles</strong>. If you were to lose some of your client relationship managers, for example, what could you do quickly to keep your reputation strong with the wider market and sustain the morale of your other staff?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Watch out for negative resources</strong>. What can you do to slow down the unfortunate events that are filling up these negative feelings? Is there anything you can do to actively dissipate them?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Build intangible measures into your performance tracking system</strong>. Reporting systems now commonly incorporate soft measures from various parts of the organization, recognizing that they are crucial to an effective system.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">If you do not know, do not ignore the issue!</strong> Soft factors <em class="emphasis">are</em> influencing your organization, continually and strongly. Remember that if you choose to ignore them, you are not actually leaving them out. Rather, you are assuming that they are OK and unchanging. This is unlikely to be the case, so make your best estimate and start tracking and understanding them.</li>
